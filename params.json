{"name":"vbench","body":"### Who made my code slower?\r\nWe write tests so we can have freedom from fear. When a commit breaks an old test, it tells us where to look to fix the issue. But when we test the performance of our project, how can we know when and where the changes in performance occurred?\r\n\r\n### What is vbench?\r\nvbench is a super-lightweight Python library to catch performance regressions. It integrates with [git](http://progit.org/book/ch1-3.html) to run performance benchmarks for every revision of your source repository, persisting the results in SQLite and generating graphs with matplotlib.\r\n\r\n![vbench plot](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/vbench/_images/dataframe_reindex_columns.png)\r\n\r\n### Example usage\r\n\r\nvbench started as a way to track performance in [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org).\r\n\r\n* [an example pandas benchmark](http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/vbench/vb_reindex.html )\r\n\r\n* [the related vbench code](https://github.com/wesm/pandas/tree/master/vb_suite/reindex.py )\r\n\r\n* [full pandas benchmark suite](https://github.com/wesm/pandas/tree/master/vb_suite )","tagline":"benchmarking performance through time","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
